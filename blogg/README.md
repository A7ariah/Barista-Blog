My project is at the beginning stages of becoming a Starbucks barista support site. It will allow users to study for there barista certifications, and communicate with there peers. My site is inspired by Quizlet (a flashcard/study website), Yik Yak ( acampus communication app), and of course the theme is modeled after the actual Starbucks website. I am still learning Javascript and look forward to updating my website to be used be used on a regular basis.

CSS and JavaScript Elements:

-Flexbox properties on the main menu.
-spin card
-Gallary Array in the about us page
